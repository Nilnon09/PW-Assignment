    "REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two popular web service communication protocols, but they differ significantly in structure and implementation. REST is lightweight, stateless, and uses standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It typically works with formats like JSON or XML and is easier to implement and integrate, especially for mobile and web applications. On the other hand, SOAP is a protocol with stricter standards. It relies exclusively on XML for message formatting and uses a more rigid structure with built-in security, error handling, and transaction compliance features.\n",

    "REST is faster and more scalable, making it suitable for public APIs and services requiring high performance.\n",

    "SOAP is more secure and standardized, often used in enterprise-level applications such as banking or telecommunication where strict security, transaction, and compliance rules are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is stateless, meaning each request from client to server must contain all the necessary information, while SOAP can be stateful or stateless depending on the needs of the operation.\n",
