    "Multithreading is a technique in Python where multiple threads (lightweight processes) run concurrently within a single process. Threads share the same memory space and resources, which makes context switching faster compared to multiprocessing.\n",

It allows tasks to run \"in parallel\" even when only one thread can run at a time due to Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
